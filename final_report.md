## Executive Summary
- (key_claim/strong/dispute=none) [events: ev-0001] OpenAI officially launched GPT-5 on August 7, 2025, making it available to all ChatGPT users and developers via API with advanced reasoning and agentic capabilities.
- (key_claim/strong/dispute=none) [events: ev-0002] GPT-5 integrates o-series advancements into a unified model family, retiring standalone models like o3 while supporting dynamic reasoning and tool chaining.
- (support/neutral/dispute=none) [events: ev-0003] The model features a 400K-token context window, enabling extended conversations and complex document processing through the new Responses API.
- (support/neutral/dispute=none) [events: ev-0004] GPT-5 outperformed GPT-4 on key benchmarks including MMLU, HumanEval, MATH, and GPQA, achieving 90% on SimpleBench, surpassing average human performance.

## Key Findings
- (key_claim/strong/dispute=none) [events: ev-0001] GPT-5 was officially released on August 7, 2025, per authoritative sources, ending prolonged speculation about its launch timeline.
- (key_claim/strong/dispute=none) [events: ev-0005] Sam Altman confirmed in October 2024 that GPT-5 would not be released that year, citing development and shipping challenges.
- (support/neutral/dispute=none) [events: ev-0006] GPT-4.5 (Orion) served as a transitional model in February 2025, improving reasoning accuracy ahead of GPT-5’s chain-of-thought architecture.
- (analysis/hedged/dispute=none) [events: none] GPT-5 unifies GPT-series and o-series models into one system, with dynamic routing between fast and deep reasoning modes based on query complexity.
- (analysis/hedged/dispute=none) [events: none] Despite multiple low-credibility claims of a May 2024 knowledge cutoff, no verified data confirms this limitation for GPT-5.
- (support/neutral/dispute=none) [events: ev-0007] OpenAI prepared for an August 2025 launch, with credible reports from Reuters confirming final readiness before official release.
